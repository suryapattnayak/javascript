		<div class="centered">Ferrari has a rich racing history and is a
			well known premium car brand. The fastest street Ferrari is the F50
			GT1, which can go over 370 kph (about 222 mph). The most powerful
			Ferrari is the FXX, which has about 800 horsepower. The FXX is a
			lighter, improved version of the F60 Enzo; it is Ferrari's most
			exclusive model, which you have to be chosen to own. It is basically
			a race car that you can buy from Ferrari. The car is so extreme
			(completely flat tires, low ride height, and no roadcar safety
			features such as Airbags) that it cannot be driven on roads legally.
			Ferrari will keep it for you at their Factory in Maranello in Italy.
			You can go to Italy and drive it on their private race track, or have
			it transported to another race track around the world, the same as if
			you were driving for a racing team. Thirty have been built and all
			but two were sold to customers for $2,500,000 each. Ferrari gave one
			to seven-time Formula 1 World Champion Michael Schumacer, who had
			driven for Ferrari for ten years when he retired in 2006, having
			brought Ferrari much success. Ferrari made his FXX different by
			painting it black. The other twenty-nine are either red or white,
			with stripes painted in the other colour.</div>
